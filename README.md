## Mars News

In Part 1, Mars News, I used BeautifulSoup to scrape the news articles from the website. I then took the titles and the summaries and stored them in a dictionary. 

## Mars Weather

In Part 2, Mars Weather, I again used BeautifulSoup to scrape the Mars Temperature Data site. The data was collected by the Curiosity Rover. I took the weather data and stored into a pandas dataframe in order to perform multiple analyzes. 

### Analysis of Mars Weather

To do the analysis, I found the coldest and warmest months based on Curiosity's location. The coldest months were March and April. Next I found the highest and lowest atmosheric pressure on Mars based on Curiosity's location.

The highest and lowest atmospheric pressure was found in the months of February and September.

### Conclusion

Though Mars is looked at as a possibility for hum settlement and exploration. I would not want to go there, because it is too cold.
